# Haskell-Snacks

A collection of modules created in-part for my COMPSCI 1JC3 course, other part to learn! One of my first attempts at Haskell and functional programming.

Modules include:
* _Snack 1_ : Computing cubic roots
* _Snack 2_ : Computations regarding vectors
* _Snack 3/3+_ : Computations regarding polynomials, representing them in two forms.
* _Snack 5_ : Approximating definite integrals.
